# NCAA Coach Salary Recommendation
The highest paid college football coaches in the nation can earn millions of dollars a year. In return, schools generate even more millions of dollars in revenue off the games themselves. This exercise is tasked with tackling the question: how can we recommend the best salary (base compensation) for Syracuseâ€™s next head football coach, with the data points at hand? The focus of this lab will be using recent public salary, game, stadium, and graduation data to predict compensation values.
