# Mushroom Classification

Over the last 5 years, mushroom hunting has been gaining popularity with nature enthusiasts. Without any expensive gear or membership fees, hunters can enjoy the thrill of finding edible fungi relatively easily, while partaking in the great outdoors. However, it is extremely important for mushroom hunters to understand where to search, and what to search for. There are various books and guides available to educate readers on what’s edible and what’s not. It is of inevitable importance that hunters understand the difference between a poisonous and edible mushroom.

This project used Kaggle's Mushroom Classification dataset for analysis and exploration. The dataset was
originally contributed to the UCI Machine Learning repository 30 years ago, and contains
descriptions of hypothetical samples belonging to over 23 species of gilled mushrooms,
specifically in the Agaricus and Leiota family (as cited from Kaggle). Each species is labeled as edible, poisonous, or unknown edidibility, and there is no simple rule that determines the edibility factor of a mushroom. The exercise was to build models that will be able to predict whether or not mushrooms are poisonous based off their features.
